This project aims to revolutionize the process of selecting the best playing eleven of
the T20 World Cup 2022 by harnessing the power of data analytics. Traditional methods of team selection, which rely heavily on subjective judgment and basic statistical
analysis, often fall short in leveraging the vast amounts of data available today. Our
approach combines modern data science techniques with comprehensive cricket data
to provide a more objective, accurate, and insightful method for team selection.
We began by collecting extensive data from the ESPNCRICINFO website using
third-party web scraping tools, as native Python libraries were not efficient enough
for our needs. The scraped data included detailed statistics on player performances,
covering various aspects such as batting, bowling, fielding, and match conditions. This
raw data was then cleaned and transformed using Python to ensure accuracy and
consistency. Data transformation involved handling missing values, normalizing data
formats, and creating new features that could enhance our analysis.
With the cleaned data, we proceeded to build a robust data model in Power BI. This
model integrated different data sources and established relationships between various
entities such as players, matches, and performance metrics. We utilized Data Analysis
Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures, allowing for dynamic
and interactive data exploration. Parameters were built using DAX to enable what-if
analysis and customizable views, enhancing the user experience and providing deeper
insights.
The core of our analysis focused on identifying the best players in key roles essential for a balanced and competitive T20 team. We evaluated openers, anchors, power
hitters, spinners, and pacers based on their performance metrics, historical data, and
current form. Advanced statistical techniques and algorithms were employed to rank
players within these categories. This analysis was visualized through interactive dashboards in Power BI, enabling stakeholders to easily explore the data and make informed
decisions.
One of the significant challenges we addressed was the complexity of cricket data,
which involves various dimensions such as player roles, match conditions, and opposition strengths. Our data model and visualizations were designed to handle this
complexity, providing a comprehensive view of each playerâ€™s impact and potential contribution to the team. The dashboards included features like drill-throughs, tooltips,
and slicers, allowing users to filter data and focus on specific aspects of player performance.
The outcome of this project is a well-balanced playing eleven selected based on
rigorous data analysis. This team composition not only highlights individual excellence
but also ensures that the collective strengths of the players are optimized. Our datadriven approach provides a more objective and reliable foundation for team selection,
reducing biases and enhancing the strategic planning process.
